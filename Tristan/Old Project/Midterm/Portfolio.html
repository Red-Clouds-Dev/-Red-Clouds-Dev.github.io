       <p>Hello</p> 
       <img src="images/OIP (2).jpg" alt="games">
       <p>I would love to make a game with my friends, All my friends are very passionate about gamming and developing games. If i were to make a game id like to make a game simular to Call Of Duty or a battle royal. Call of Duty because a simple fps is a lot of fun and you can make the skill gap high by the design of the maps. A battol royal because everyone plays them and as long as its a new concept and its visually appealing a BR should be successful.</p>
