       <h3>About Me</h3>
       <p> Hello, my name is Tristan Jordan. I am very excited to learn more about coding, Ive been wanting to learn how to code for a very long time. I have been using computers sense I was 10 and I have always found them facinateing</p> 
       <img src="images/OIP (1).jpg" alt="games">
       <p>I want to design games for a living and I think the best company for me to work would be <a href="blizzard.html">Blizzard</a> because they have some of the biggest game titles. My dad works for microsoft so Ive always had someone who can help me get a job in game design. However, around four months ago Microsoft bought out blizzard for 4 billion. That is probably the best thing for me because it will a lot easier for my dad to get me a job in Microsft. Other than that I have a cat <a href="Mr.Pain.html">Mr.Pain</a>, a <a href="cars.html">hellcat</a> that I like to race with friends and I love to play <a href="gaming.html">games</a>.  </p>
