       <p>What is osu ? osu! A free rhythm game developed, published and created primarily by Dean "peppy" Herbert.  Inspired by the iNiS rhythm game Osu! Fight! Written in C #, released for Microsoft Windows on  September 16, 2007</p>

       <p> In osu! The beat map consists of three elements: a hit circle, a slider, and a spinner. Collectively, these items are called "hit objects" or "circles" and are placed in different positions on the screen at different times in the song. The beat map has drum beats and spinners. The beatmap is then played in music, simulating the sense of rhythm as the player interacts with the object in time with the music.</p>
