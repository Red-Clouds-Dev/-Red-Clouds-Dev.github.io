       <h3>About Me</h3>
       <p> Hello, my name is Tristan Jordan. I am very excited to learn more about coding, Ive been wanting to learn how to code for a very long time. I have been using computers sense I was 10 and I have always found them facinateing</p> 
       <img src="images/OIP (1).jpg" alt="games">
       <p>I want to design games for a living and I think the best company for me to work would be Blizzard because they have some of the biggest game titles. My dad works for microsoft so Ive always had someone who can help me get a job in game design. However, around four months ago Microsoft bought out blizzard for 4 billion. That is probably the best thing for me because it will a lot easier for my dad to get me a job in Microsft. Other than that I have a cat Mr.Pain, a hellcat that I like to race with friends and I love to play games.  </p>
