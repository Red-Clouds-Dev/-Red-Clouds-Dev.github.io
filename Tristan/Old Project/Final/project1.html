           <h3>Project 1</h3>
           <p>1) First, we needed to think of what type of game wanted and we all settled on a MMORPG</p>
           <img src="images/Switch_Skyrim_ND0913_SCRN_10.png" alt=""> 
           
           <p>2) Next we had to think what to put into the game, Because were only in programming 3 we dont know anything to complx yet so we just have the base calss down</p>
           <img src="images/solution.png" alt="solution">
          
           <p>3) We thought that the best thing to start with will be the player class because were confident we know what should go in this class and what functions we want it to have.</p>
           <img src="images/Player.png" alt="Player">
          
           <p>4) After we had the player class we wanted to make a simple character class that would do simple things</p>
           <img src="images/character.png" alt="character">
          
           <p>5) We had the two main classes now we need to add the methods that will allow them to do things </p>
           <img src="images/Methods .png" alt="Methods">
           <p>6) That brings us to our first problem of how to take it so when the person spends money it will take it away </p>
           <p>7) Another problem is what do we want people to start at with money, what is to low and what is to high</p>
           <p>8) Now we need to make a Buy() method so that People can spend money in the game  </p>
           <img src="images/R.jpg " alt="buy">
           <p>9) With a buy() method you also need a sell() method so you can make money so we added that</p>
           <p>10) The last confusing thing we had to add was to make it so you start at level 1 and 0 xp</p>
           <img src="images/R (1).jpg " alt="game">
           <p>11) Through killing animals and enimes you earn xp and if you get enough xp you go up in level</p>
           <p>12) We still have a long way to go til you can play the game but its been a lot of fun making the classes and thinking how they will work in later</p>
