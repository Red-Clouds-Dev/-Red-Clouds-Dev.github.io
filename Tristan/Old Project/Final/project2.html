       <h3>Project 2</h3>
       <p>1) For my week 9 project I made the Content Management System </p> 
       <img src="images/Screenshot 2022-06-19 173340.png" alt="Screenshot">
       <p>2) The first big problem I ran into was how to return everything as a string and be able to put it into one textbox</p>
       <img src="images/finalPic 1.png" alt="finalPic">
       
       <p>3) After I figured out hot to put all the users inputs into a string I had to figure out how to place then on a seporate line becasue \n wasnt working </p>
       <img src="images/FinalPic3.png" alt="finalPic">
       <p>4) When I had all the information in the new textbox I needed to beable to change the font color </p>
       <img src="images/FinalPic2.png" alt="finalPic">
           <p>5) So far ive learned that its really hard to get all the infromation from the textbox so I should have just used a listbox</p>
           <p>6) After I thought everything was working the program wasnt displaying the correct infromation because I didnt call the method </p>
           <p>7) It was also hard to make it so i get the correct infromation from the calendar becasue there were multiple differant options  </p>
           <p>8) I needed to use DatTimePicker becasue the other calendar required you to put in all your own infromation</p>
           <p>9) For the combobox i needed to make sure I picked the correct index for when they selected a color the new textbox would change to that color</p>
           <p>10) I learned that for the background color to change i need to run a if else check and when the if passes it will change the background color</p>
           <p>11) when I had it all put togeather and all the code was working the textbox wouldent display the new infromation because it was disabled</p>
           <p>12) when I changedthe property to enable it finally worked</p>
